- 👋 Hi, I’m John
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of data and using Python coding for development of machine learning models. I like to analyse different data sets and develop ways to identify key insights into a data structure. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning neural networks and decision trees for predictive models. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on all works that relate to machine learning models and data science areas to develop more expertise in a commercial setting.
